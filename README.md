# Example Frontend

This is an example React.js project that is meant to give a demonstration of the ExampleAPI we built [here](https://github.com/jared-v-hoyt/ExampleAPI).

To run the project, first clone the project to your local maching by opening a new terminal (or Powershell for Windows) and running the following commands:

```bash
cd Desktop
git clone https://github.com/jared-v-hoyt/ExampleAPI
cd ExampleAPI
```

Next, we need to install all necessary dependencies. Run the following commands in the same terminal as before:

```bash
npm install
cd src
npm start
```

The project _should_ automatically open up in your default browser and start running. If nothing shows up, open up your browser and visit the following url:

```bash
http://localhost:3000/
```
